# ruler-ai

**ruler-ai** is a ruleset and project system generation tool for AI agents across multiple environments. This tool will help you generate rules files with an opinionated method to help you generate good, functional code.

## üåç Supported Environments

- **Windsurf**: Comprehensive project management and code-assistant rules.
- **Roo VSCode extension**: Uses the same rules and methods as Windsurf.
- **GitHub Copilot**: Uses the same rules and methods as Windsurf.
- **Cursor**: Focus on code-assistant (less project management) focused rules.

## üöÄ  Getting started with ruler-ai

This is the workflow how you, the developer, will use this system to generate good code.

1. **Fork and/or clone ruler-ai** to your development environment.
2. **Copy and modify** [`CODE-RULES.md`](./CODE-RULES.md) for your needs manually into your project folder.
3. **Copy `project/`** into your project folder.
4. **Modify** `PRD.md` and `TASKS.md` to your project needs.
5. **Start coding!**

## üìö How the Rules Work

- **`.cursor/global.mdc`**: Concise, code-assistant-focused rules. Emphasizes working directly from the `project` folder for requirements, tasks, and state. Promotes clarity, minimal code, and always asks for clarification if requirements are unclear.

- **`.roo/rules-code/rules.md` & `.windsurfrules` & `.github/copilot-instructions.md`**: Full project management and code quality rules. Require agents to:
  - Review `project/PRD.md` (architecture, style), `project/TASKS.md` (assignments), and optionally `project/digest.txt` (state) before coding.
  - Present a plan before making changes.
  - Only work on assigned tasks.
  - Follow strict folder structure (`src/` for all code).
  - Write tests, document decisions, and update the README as needed.

## üóÇÔ∏è The `project` Folder: The Source of Truth

- **`project/PRD.md`**: Product requirements, architecture, and project-specific style guide.
- **`project/TASKS.md`**: Task assignments and tracking.
- **(Optional) `project/digest.txt`**: Current project state or summary. Generated by [code2prompt](https://github.com/mufeedvh/code2prompt/) or any other equivalent tool.

## Manual Development Workflow

For the developer condensing [`CODE-RULES.md`](./CODE-RULES.md) down into rules specific to each IDE:

1. Update [`CODE-RULES.md`](./CODE-RULES.md).
2. Run this prompt to shorten for Windsurf/Roo/GitHub:

```prompt
Given the following AI IDE <RULES>, shorten the wording to save on tokens, but make sure the intent, spirit, and technical details of each guideline are kept so an AI can clearly understand it. Return these rules in markdown format that can be copy/pasted.
<RULES>
<!-- Content of CODE-RULES.md here -->
</RULES>
```

3. Place output of prompt into [`CODE-RULES-CONDENSED.md`](./CODE-RULES-CONDENSED.md)
4. Run `python update-rules.py`.
5. Update your rules in your projects as needed.
