# Product Requirements Document (Platform Foundation)

## 1. Introduction

- **Product Vision:** [Overall long-term goal and aspiration for the product.]
- **Problem Statement:** [Detailed explanation of the problem this product solves or the opportunity it addresses.]
- **Target Audience & Personas:** [Detailed description of primary and secondary users for the overall product.]
- **Value Proposition (Overall Product):** [What unique benefit will the complete product offer?]

## 2. Goals & Objectives

- **Business Goals (Overall Product):** [e.g., Market share, revenue, user acquisition.]
- **Platform Foundation Goals:** [Specific, measurable goals for establishing the core platform, e.g., "Establish a scalable backend architecture using Go," "Implement a shared user authentication service with clearly defined Go interfaces," "Define clear API contracts (e.g., gRPC/Protobuf or REST with OpenAPI) for future feature modules."]
- **Success Metrics (Platform Foundation):** [How will the success of the foundation be measured? e.g., "Ease of integrating new features developed via FDW," "Stability and performance of core platform services," "Clarity of internal API documentation for feature developers."]

## 3. Core Platform Components & Shared Services (Foundation Scope)

[This section details the essential, non-user-facing components, shared services, or foundational modules that constitute the core platform. These are the building blocks designed to be consumed by future features developed via the FDW.]

### Core Component/Service 1: [e.g., User Authentication & Authorization Service]

- **Purpose:** [e.g., Provide centralized, secure authentication (e.g., JWT, OAuth2) and authorization (e.g., RBAC) mechanisms for all current and future product features.]
- **Key Capabilities/APIs (Conceptual Contracts):** [e.g., `RegisterUser(UserDetails) -> UserID|Error`, `Login(Credentials) -> SessionToken|Error`, `ValidateToken(SessionToken) -> UserPermissions|Error`, `CheckPermission(UserID, Resource, Action) -> bool|Error`. Focus on the interface contract.]
- **Technical Considerations:** [e.g., Password hashing algorithms, token issuer, integration with potential identity providers, database schema for users/roles/permissions.]

### Core Component/Service 2: [e.g., Centralized Configuration Service]

- **Purpose:** [e.g., A shared service for managing and distributing dynamic configuration to all other services and feature modules.]
- **Key Capabilities/APIs (Conceptual Contracts):** [e.g., `GetConfig(serviceName, environment) -> ConfigObject|Error`.]
- **Technical Considerations:** [e.g., Storage backend for configs, caching strategy, update propagation.]

*(Add more core foundational components/services as needed)*

## 4. Technical Specifications (Platform Foundation)

- **Primary Language(s) & Version(s):** [e.g., Go 1.2X for backend services, Python 3.1X for data tooling, SvelteKit X.Y for a potential platform admin UI.]
- **Key Frameworks/Libraries (Foundation):** [e.g., Go: Gin/Echo for APIs, gRPC; Svelte: SvelteKit; Python: FastAPI. List major libraries for ORM, testing, etc., that will be standard for the platform.]
- **Database (Platform):** [e.g., PostgreSQL for primary data, Redis for caching/sessions. Specify versions.]
- **Key APIs/Integrations (Platform-Level):** [External APIs essential for the platform's operation, e.g., cloud provider SDKs, Stripe API for a core billing service.]
- **High-Level Architectural Approach (Extensible & Modular):** [e.g., "Modular Monolith in Go with clearly defined internal package interfaces designed for future separation if needed," "Microservices architecture using Go, with gRPC for inter-service communication and an API Gateway." Emphasize design for extensibility to support FDW. A Mermaid diagram for high-level components, showing separation of platform vs. future feature areas, is highly recommended.]

```mermaid

    subgraph "Platform Foundation"
        AuthN["User AuthN/AuthZ Service (Go)"]
        ConfigSvc["Configuration Service (Go)"]
        ApiGW["API Gateway / Service Bus (Go)"]
        SharedDB[("Shared Platform DB (Postgres)")]
        AdminUI["Platform Admin UI (SvelteKit)"] --- ApiGW
    end
    subgraph "Future Feature Modules (via FDW)"
        Feature1["Feature Module 1 (Go/Python/...")] --o ApiGW
        Feature2["Feature Module 2 (Go/Python/...")] --o ApiGW
    end
    AuthN --> SharedDB
    ConfigSvc --> SharedDB
    ApiGW o-- AuthN
    ApiGW o-- ConfigSvc
```

- **Deployment Target (Platform):** [e.g., Docker containers orchestrated by Kubernetes, Serverless functions on AWS Lambda/Google Cloud Functions.]
- **Critical Technical Decisions & Constraints (Platform):** [e.g., "All inter-service communication MUST use Protobuf definitions," "Shared libraries for platform concerns (logging, config) MUST be versioned and consumed by feature modules." These decisions will guide FDW.]

### 4.1. Proposed Folder Structure (Platform Foundation)

[Describe the intended top-level folder structure for the project. Use a tree format. This structure should accommodate core platform services and allow for clear separation of future feature modules developed via FDW. Consider monorepo vs. polyrepo implications if applicable.]

#### Key Directory Descriptions

- `/docs`: [Purpose: Contains all project documentation, including this PRD, architectural diagrams, and future Feature PRDs.]
- `/platform`: [Purpose: Houses all the source code and configurations for the core platform services and shared libraries.]
- `/platform/auth_service`: [Purpose: Specific Go service managing user authentication and authorization.]
- `/features`: [Purpose: Top-level directory where individual feature modules, developed via FDW, will reside. Each sub-directory will be a self-contained feature.]

*(Add descriptions for other key top-level directories as defined by the user/Gem)*

## 5. Data Management (Platform Foundation)

- **Key Shared Data Entities & Schemas:** [List and define schemas for data entities essential for the platform and shared across multiple future features, e.g., `User`, `Organization`, `SystemConfiguration`. Use Go struct definitions or SQL DDL as examples.]
- **Data Persistence Strategy (Platform):** [e.g., "Primary data in PostgreSQL, accessed via a Go data layer using `sqlx` or GORM. Migrations managed by `migrate`."]
- **Data Flow Overview (Core Platform Operations):** [Conceptual flow for platform-level data, e.g., user registration data flow. Mermaid sequence diagram optional but helpful.]

## 6. User Experience (UX) & Design (Platform Admin UI & Branding - If Applicable)

[This section focuses *only* on any UI the platform itself might require, like an admin dashboard for managing the platform, or global branding to be used by features.]

- **Overall Branding Guidelines (if any):** [Link to or define basic colors, logo usage. This is for the rare case where the platform dictates branding for features.]
- **Platform Admin UI (if applicable):** [Conceptual design for a SvelteKit-based admin interface to manage users, configurations, monitor platform health, etc. Key screens/flows.]

## 7. Future Features / Expansion Roadmap

**Guidance for Feature Developer Workflow (FDW):** The following user-facing features are planned for development using the Feature Developer Workflow. Each feature will be scoped and designed in its own dedicated Feature PRD, which must reference this core Product PRD for platform context, API contracts, and technical standards. The platform foundation established by this PRD is specifically designed to support the modular and independent development of these (and other) features.

### Feature: [Feature Name 1]

- **Description:** [One-sentence description of the user-facing feature.]
- **Potential Core Platform Services Consumed:** [e.g., User Auth Service, Notification Service]
- **Status:** Planned

### Feature: [Feature Name 2]

- **Description:** [One-sentence description of the user-facing feature.]
- **Potential Core Platform Services Consumed:** [e.g., User Auth Service, Data Storage Service (if one exists)]
- **Status:** Planned

*(Add more future features as identified)*

## 8. Out of Scope (for Platform Foundation Build)

[Clearly list specific user-facing features (those in the roadmap above), detailed UI elements beyond a core platform admin shell, or any functionality that is *not* part of the initial platform build and is explicitly deferred to the FDW.]

## 9. Project-Specific Coding Rules & Standards (Platform-Wide and FDW Guidance)

- **Language Version(s):** [e.g., Go 1.21+, SvelteKit (latest LTS)]
- **Formatting:** [e.g., `gofmt`, `prettier` for Svelte.]
- **Linting:** [e.g., `golangci-lint` (with specific config), `eslint-plugin-svelte`.]
- **Key Architectural Principles (Mandatory for FDW):**
  - "Feature modules MUST interact with core platform services only through their defined API contracts (e.g., gRPC, REST)."
  - "Feature modules SHOULD be deployable independently of the core platform and other feature modules, where feasible."
  - "Feature modules MUST NOT directly access the databases of other services/modules unless explicitly designed and approved as part of a data-sharing strategy."
  - "Shared platform libraries (e.g., for logging, custom error types) will be provided and MUST be used by feature modules to ensure consistency."
- **API Design Standards (for internal APIs):** [e.g., "All REST APIs must follow OpenAPI v3 specifications," "gRPC services must have versioned .proto files."]
- **Naming Conventions:** [Specify by language, e.g., Go package naming, Svelte component naming.]
- **Testing Strategy (Platform Foundation):** [e.g., "Unit tests for all shared services and core logic (Go: `testing` package). Integration tests for internal API contracts between platform components. For Svelte admin UI: Component tests with Vitest/Testing Library."]

## 10. Open Questions / Risks (Platform Foundation)

[Any unresolved questions or identified risks for building the foundational platform, especially those that might impact FDW later.]
